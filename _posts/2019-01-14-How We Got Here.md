title: How I Decided To Do This & Where It Is Today?
published: true

I own an IT company and went to a CDW "Executive Summit" conference in Chicago. I expected to learn about new products for sale, how CDW was awesome, etc. - but, I was instead able to listen to some of the greatest names in the IT world and it was all about data science, deep learning, analytics, automation, etc. I was inspired to say the least. Finally, I can solve real world problems and use math and technology to do it! How was I just finding out about this?!?

I went back to Morgantown, WV and decided my company, <a href="http://www.itmindshare.com" target="_blank">IT Mindshare</a>, would figure out how to offer data analytics services. We had already decided that moving from services to shared business objectives was key for success (think: helping solve computer issues to sell more cars vs just selling you a new laptop). We want our clients to pay for services that make them better than their competition. I started talking to clients about predictive analytics and was blown away by the interest and excitement. I knew that I would have to learn some tools (R, Python, etc.) and get trained ASAP, or hire someone to do this work for us. As I dug deeper, I realize!
d I probably needed to do both. 

I decided to start a new company, Data Mindshare, where I will work with two Ph.D. professors that have extensive backgrounds in statistics and HR/Process Management. I'll bring the business experience and sales to the table and begin working on becoming a respected data scientist myself. We have now developed a strategy based on CRISP-DM and we've spoken to a few potential leads. We expect to begin working up our portfolio in the first quarter with simple and effective projects for our new clients. I've already started training in R and signed up for a college program (more to come on those later). So, we're off to the races and it's exciting to so quickly be involved in such a fascinating field!
