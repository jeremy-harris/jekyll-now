title: Why I Chose R over Python
published: true
---
I have used programming languages before, but mostly for projects. I knew that I needed to get the basics down again, but which language to choose? I spent several hours trying to figure out if I wanted to start out in R or Python. Here's how I made the decision to learn R over Python. 

I actually think I like Python better. It seems to integrate more easily with the web and be a more robust platform with some great packages. However, I chose R because my primary goal, at least initially, is analytics. This, combined with a friend and advisor is fluent in R. I thought about learning Python to bring something new to the table, but then thought better of it. As a newbie, I'll just do what I can to learn R and be able to speak intelligently about what is going on. <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-or-python-for-data-analysis" target="_blank">This article</a> from DataCamp breaks it down nicely as well.

My strategy is pretty simple - I want to learn the language quickly, complete some exercises and a few projects of my own so that I am capable of understanding what is possible. I am certain that when I start using packages and math, I'll be searching for syntax - and that's ok. I just want to understand what to search for and be able to follow along looking at code. 

# My Starting Solution == DataCamp
What a great find in <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/home" target="_blank">DataCamp</a>! I paid for the yearly membership and immediately enrolled in the 'Data Science in R' program. It's been perfect. I'm able to learn, practice and implement right away and at a steady pace. I highly recommend it. In addition, I highly recommend the DataCamp podcasts via <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast" target="_blank">DataFramed</a>.
