title: I Started the Data Analytics Certificate Program at Texas!

I've had to take a break from Data Camp for a while, although I still listen to the podcasts almost every day. I started the <a href="https://professionaled.utexas.edu/data-analytics-certificate-program" target="_blank">Data Analytics Certificate Program </a>offered by the University of Texas this week....and I love it! The very first class jumps right in to working with a sample dataset of sales data. We are asked to analyze the data in RapidMiner and determine various details about the data. We even started working on decision trees and applying machine learning tools to try and predict certain attributes based on the provided variables. It's been fun and a wild learning curve so far! 

Here's one of my first decision trees to try and predict if a person would shop online or not based on where they live, their age, and the amount of the transaction.

<b>Something for everyone - and it's free!</b> <a href="https://docs.rapidminer.com/downloads/DataMiningForTheMasses.pdf" target="_blank">Data Mining For The Masses</a>. This is a free eBook and accompanying website that has test datasets and provides real world examples using RapidMiner (which is also free). If you are just learning data analytics/science - this is a great place to start and it's free!

Here's a pie chart I made showing the age range makeup of customers that shopped online for the client (after some cool binning discretization and aggregation grouping by variables).

I've also been reading this book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Statistics-Absolute-Beginners-English-Introduction-ebook/dp/B0761PT1FD" target="_blank">Statistics for Absolute Beginners</a> because I am a statistical newbie. It is really good at breaking down statistics and has been a good reference for keeping me on track with the Data Camp courses and Texas course. 

Why did I choose the Texas course? I can't lie - I looked at Texas first because I am from Texas and love UT! But, besides that, it is a great course that is immersive and gets you going right away. Additionally, I think having a well-known school on a resume is part of the value. I compared Texas to Stanford and a few others, and the Texas class was much less (around $5,500). So, really it was reputation, personal choice and price. They will let you make payments over a small period of time to help you bite the bullet as well. I encourage anyone that looks at data on a regular basis to check it out as well as Data Camp and the Data Mining for Everyone resource. 

Until next time...keep the data coming!
