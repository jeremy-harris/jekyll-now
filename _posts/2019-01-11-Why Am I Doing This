title: Why Am I Doing This?
published: true

I'm a military veteran, own a successful IT company, sold a self-defense training company and for some reason, I want to pursue the study of data analytics and re-invent myself. I have always like math and analytics but for some reason, never pursued it as a profession. In an attempt to offer great services to our clients, I kept trying to find new ways to answer tough problems and that let me to this new ill-defined bease, 'Data Science'. The more I read, the more I liked. I'm in. 

So, why the blog? I've listened to countless hours of podcasts from DataFramed. Virtually everyone says to starta  blog, even if you don't know what you're doing. So, I'm blogging about my journet into the newest high-tech, buzz-word filled, somewhat mystical and 100% fascinating world of data science. Hell, even trying to figure out how to start a blog on GitHub (and oh yeah, what is GitHub?) proved to be far more of a learning curve than I anticipated. But, here we are. Hopefully something useful comes from this. Predictions anyone? I mean, if you're into that sort of thing....
