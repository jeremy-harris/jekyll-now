I'm an entreprenuer who loves solving problems. I own a successful IT company and I've sold a self-defense training company. I'm starting this blog to document my journey into the "new world" of Data Science as I try to figure all of this out and chart out on a new adventure of turning myself into a well respected data scientist. I hope you (and I) enjoy the journey!
