I'm an entreprenuer who loves solving problems. I started and still own a successful technology & security firm and I've started and sold other smaller companies along the way. I'm taking my talents and passion to solve problems and explore opportunities with data analytics and data science. This is a blog of my journey, projects, findings, musings and ramblings. I hope you enjoy it!
